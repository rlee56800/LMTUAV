# Python-UAV-Collision-Avoidance
This project is under Cal Poly Pomona UAV project

# Direction 
* All relevant code is under the SIM folder
    * sim.py sets things up for the plane and calls planeClass_SIM.py
    * planeClass_SIM.py contains all the flight code (i.e. collision detection/avoidance)
